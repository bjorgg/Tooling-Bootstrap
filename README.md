# Tooling - Bootstrap

A made up film festival website set up with Bootstrap.
It containes two pages, home and films.

I used navbar, jumbotron, carousel, grids and footer from the Bootstrap framework
and styled it with bootstrap assets.

On one hand I thought it complicated things having to figure out the styling of the framework
because I knew how to do them in css. But on the other hand there is so much that you get with it
that simplify the work like the responsiveness.
